Some have speculated that the figures are actually meant to be Mary Magdalene fleeing with her child to France after its father, Jesus, was crucified. This is part of a wider theory (made popular by Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code) that the cult of Mary Magdalene was central to the Knights Templar, and the Holy Grail is really the bloodline of Jesus.（Stephen Millar, Leith Walk 2017, p.375）</p>"+'<div><img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/30/c2/3lCNuxPL_o.png"><img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/28/3e/6A3W0A3c_o.png"></div>'

He was actually a Scotsman who allied himself with the revolutionary cause and earned himself the reputation as the founder of the American navy.<p>Leith Fort was designed by James Craig (1739-95) — best known for winning a competition in 1766 for a plan for the original New Town in Edinburgh (see p.154). Despite this early promise, his career was never very successful and little of his work survives today.

In 1945 it was sold to the National Trust for Scotland, after both the owner and his son died within months of each other, the latter killed in a motorcycle accident.<p>A variety of supernatural phenomena has been reported at the hall, including the ghost of a White Lady, who has been sighted on the first floor. Dressed in 18th century attire, it's believed that she haunts the music room, and some say she is the spirit of Harriet Stuart. The owner of the hall who was killed in a motorcycle accident has also been seen wandering about the grounds in military uniform. Mysterious sounds have been reported as well, including those of invisible children laughing, people partying, and booted feet tramping about late at night. Sudden drops in temperature have also been experienced, not to mention strange and inexplicable odours.</p><p>However the most well-known presence at the hall is that of Laird John Leith III Esq. He has been witnessed on numerous occasions, most strikingly on July 16, 1968, when novelist Elizabeth Byrd spotted the spectre in one of the bedrooms. She wrote how the apparition was that of a man wearing bloodsoaked bandages around his head and moaning most piteously, describing the phantom as being solid in appearance as opposed to indistinct. When shown a portrait of Leith, Byrd said the painting resembled the figure she had seen.</p>"+'<div id="link">source: <a href="http://mrwright.byethost13.com/leith-hall.html?i=1">'+'http://mrwright.byethost13.com/leith-hall.html?i=1</a></div>'+'</a></div>'+'<div><img src="images/.png"></div>'

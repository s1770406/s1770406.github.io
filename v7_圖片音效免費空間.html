This is part of a wider theory (made popular by Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code) that the cult of Mary Magdalene was central to the Knights Templar, and the Holy Grail is really the bloodline of Jesus.（Stephen Millar, Leith Walk 2017, p.375）</p>"+'<div><img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/b4/83/Jf7ca6xB_o.png"><img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/18/eb/9Xlwx3mU_o.png"></div>'

Only bad weather prevented Jones from capturing Leith. He was actually a Scotsman who allied himself with the revolutionary cause and earned himself the reputation as the founder of the American navy.<p>Leith Fort was designed by James Craig (1739-95) — best known for winning a competition in 1766 for a plan for the original New Town in Edinburgh. Despite this early promise, his career was never very successful and little of his work survives today. The army left the fort in 1957 after 164 years of being based in Leith and it was largely demolished in the following years.（Stephen Millar, Leith Walk 2017, p.386）</p>"+'<div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Leith_Fort_boundary_wall.jpg"></div>'

Dressed in 18th century attire, it's believed that she haunts the music room, and some say she is the spirit of Harriet Stuart. The owner of the hall who was killed in a motorcycle accident has also been seen wandering about the grounds in military uniform. Mysterious sounds have been reported as well, including those of invisible children laughing, people partying, and booted feet tramping about late at night. Sudden drops in temperature have also been experienced, not to mention strange and inexplicable odours.</p><p>However the most well-known presence at the hall is that of Laird John Leith III Esq.

He was a pillar of Edinburgh society: a successful cabinet maker; Deacon of the Guild of Wrights and Masons; and an Edinburgh City Councillor. But he was also a man with a serious gambling habit who needed to maintain not just the family everyone knew about, but also two mistresses and five illegitimate children. The wider picture in Scotland at the time is set out in our Historical Timeline.<p>William Brodie's father had been a cabinet maker before him, and William served an apprenticeship that led to his work being regarded as some of the best in Edinburgh. He grew to become a supplier of furniture to the rich and famous. Part of the work had to be undertaken in customers' homes and business premises, installing furniture or fitting locks.</p>But Edinburgh had a dark side, an underworld of vice and crime, and Deacon Brodie came to know it well. He would frequent drinking and gambling dens, and by 1768 had run up serious debts to the sort of people you really wouldn't want to owe money to. His lifestyle was becoming increasingly expensive in other ways, too. By day he was a respectable family man: by night he maintained two mistresses (neither of whom knew of the other's existence) who between them had borne him five illegitimate children.<p>Deacon Brodie first turned to crime as a means of resolving his problems in 1768, when he was able to take impressions of the keys to a bank in the city. His subsequent night-time robbery of the bank netted him £800, a large amount at the time. To further his criminal activities, Deacon Brodie recruited an English locksmith, George Smith, and between them they launched a highly successful crime wave across the city, even stealing Edinburgh University's silver mace.</p>By 1786 Brodie's gang had grown to four, after he recruited two more members, Ainslie and Brown. Brodie was becoming more ambitious in his criminal activities, and later in 1786 planned an audacious raid on His Majesty's Excise Office in Chessel's Court, off Canongate. Brodie's role was to act as lookout, but he fell asleep. As a result the authorities, alerted to the robbery in progress, came very close to capturing the whole gang red-handed. In the event, Brodie and two others narrowly escaped, but Ainsley was captured.<p>Ainsley quickly turned King's Evidence to avoid the gallows, and Smith and Brown were also arrested. Deacon Brodie fled to Amsterdam, where he lay low for a while, before being arrested on the point of boarding a ship bound for North America and returned to Edinburgh in chains."+'<div id="link">Source : <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/b/deaconbrodie.html">'+'https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/b/deaconbrodie.html</a><br>Read more: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brodie">'+'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brodie</a></br></div>'+'</a></div>'+'<div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Edinburgh._Brodie%27s_Close._Deacon%27s_House_Cafe.jpg"></div>'

Bobby soon touched the hearts of the local residents when he refused to leave his master’s grave, even in the worst weather conditions.The gardener and keeper of Greyfriars tried on many occasions to evict Bobby from the Kirkyard. In the end he gave up and provided a shelter for Bobby by placing sacking beneath two tablestones at the side of John Gray’s grave.Bobby’s fame spread throughout Edinburgh. It is reported that almost on a daily basis the crowds would gather at the entrance of the Kirkyard waiting for the one o’clock gun that would signal the appearance of Bobby leaving the grave for his midday meal.Bobby would follow William Dow, a local joiner and cabinet maker to the same Coffee House that he had frequented with his now dead master, where he was given a meal.<p>In 1867 a new bye-law was passed that required all dogs to be licensed in the city or they would be destroyed. Sir William Chambers (The Lord Provost of Edinburgh) decided to pay Bobby’s licence and presented him with a collar with a brass inscription “Greyfriars Bobby from the Lord Provost 1867 licensed”. This can be seen at the Museum of Edinburgh. The kind folk of Edinburgh took good care of Bobby, but still he remained loyal to his master. For fourteen years the dead man’s faithful dog kept constant watch and guard over the grave until his own death in 1872. Baroness Angelia Georgina Burdett-Coutts, President of the Ladies Committee of the RSPCA, was so deeply moved by his story that she asked the City Council for permission to erect a granite fountain with a statue of Bobby placed on top."+'<div id="link">source: <a href="http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Greyfriars-Bobby/">'+'http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Greyfriars-Bobby/</a></div>'+'</a></div>'+'http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Greyfriars-Bobby/<div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Greyfriars-bobby-edin.jpg"></div>'

The 16 new galleries reopened in 2011 include 8,000 objects, 80 per cent of which were not formerly on display.[2] One of the more notable exhibits is the stuffed body of Dolly the sheep, the first successful clone of a mammal from an adult cell. Other highlights include Ancient Egyptian exhibitions, one of Elton John's extravagant suits and a large kinetic sculpture named the Millennium Clock. A Scottish invention that is a perennial favourite with school parties is The Maiden, an early form of guillotine. In 2016, the museum had 1.81 million visitors over the year, making it Scotland's most popular visitor attraction during that period."+'<div id="link">source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Scotland">'+'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Scotland</a><br>Wedsite: <a href="https://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/">'+'https://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/</a></br></div>'+'</a></div>'+'<div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Museum_of_Scotland.jpg"></div>'

The drill hall was designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson as the headquarters of the 5th Volunteer Battalion Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment) and was completed in 1901. This unit evolved to become the 7th (Leith) Battalion, The Royal Scots in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to Gallipoli. In 1915 the Gretna disaster, the worst crash in the history of British rail travel, killed 227 people and injured 246 others. 102 of those killed were young men from the 7th (Leith) Battalion of the Royal Scots, on their way to Liverpool, where they were to leave for Gallipoli. The bodies of the victims were laid out in the drill hall prior to burial in Rosebank Cemetery, across Leith Walk in Pilrig. The drill hall is therefore connected to one of the greatest tragedies to affect the community of Leith."+'<div id="link">source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmeny_Street_drill_hall">'+'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmeny_Street_drill_hall</a></div>'+'</a></div>'+'<div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Dalmeny_Street_Drill_Hall.jpg"></div>'

It also hosts events for the Edinburgh Science Festival and Edinburgh International Magic Festival and others, and provides a home for arts practitioners year round; its over 600 rooms are used for art exhibitions, libraries, small museums, educational & research programmes, artist studios. offices, labs and workshops. About 400 people work there. It receives half a million visitors and produces and hosts over 700 shows and events annually. There is a gastro-pub bar and café with home-cooking.<p>Early records show the Summerhall site was a farm, a cottage, and a family run brewery in the 1710s. All that remains of this brewery are a well and stone rubble sandstone boundary wall. Terraced houses, two churches, and shops occupied the site for many years, until they made way for the purpose-built Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, built during World War I, when the veterinary school moved there from North St Andrews Street and Clyde Street (now Multrees walk) in the city centre. Summerhall retains many items on display from the veterinary school's history. Summerhall believe in adapting the arts to spaces to retain as much of the building's inherited character as possible. Most artists and theatre companies prefer exhibiting and performing in spaces with an explicit history rather than in clinically new or relatively soulless places and spaces.</p>"+'<div id="link">source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhall">'+'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhall</a><br>Website: <a href="https://www.summerhall.co.uk/">'+'https://www.summerhall.co.uk/</a></br></div>'+'</a></div>'+'<div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Summerhall_arts_hub.JPG"></div>'

The transitory nature of the sculpture park makes it hard to believe it is only ten miles outside of Edinburgh. Full of surprises, from the initial confrontation of Charles Jencks' 'Life Mounds', which visitors drive through on entering the park, to the jovial creation by Jim Lambie, which both delights and astonishes. With no set routes through the park and an emphasis on exploration and discovery the individual is left to engage with the artworks and the land as a whole. Continuing the theme of self discovery, Jupiter values education and is committed to providing an educational resource for schools in the region and maintaining a charitable status.
